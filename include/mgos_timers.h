/*
 * Mongoose OS supports two types of timers: software timers and hardware
 * timers.
 *
 * - Software timers. Implemented as Mongoose library events, in software.
 *   Timer callback is called in a Mongoose task context. Frequency is
 *   specified in milliseconds. Number of software timers is not limited.
 *   Timer intervals cannot be short - limited by the underlying
 *   task scheduling. For example, if you want a very frequent sensor reading,
 *   like thousand readings a second, use hardware timer instead.
 *   Both C and JavaScript API is available.
 * - Hardware timers. Implemented in hardware. Timer callback is executed in
 *   the ISR context, therefore it can do a limited set of actions.
 *   Number of hardware timers is limied: (ESP8266: 1, ESP32: 4, CC32xx: 4).
 *   Frequency is specified in microseconds. Only C API is present, because
 *   calling to JS requires switching to Mongoose task context.
 *
 * Usage example:
 * ```c
 * #include "mgos_app.h"
 * #include "mgos_system.h"
 * #include "mgos_timers.h"
 *
 * static void my_timer_cb(void *arg) {
 *   bool val = mgos_gpio_toggle(mgos_sys_config_get_pins_led());
 *   LOG(LL_INFO, ("uptime: %.2lf", mgos_uptime()));
 *   (void) arg;
 * }
 *
 * enum mgos_app_init_result mgos_app_init(void) {
 *   mgos_set_timer(1000, MGOS_TIMER_REPEAT, my_timer_cb, NULL);
 *   return MGOS_APP_INIT_SUCCESS;
 * }
 * ```
