 * Definitions for the user-defined app entry point, `mgos_app_init()`.
 *
 * The `mgos_app_init()` function is like the `main()` function in the C
 * program. This is a app's entry point.
 *
 * The mongoose-os core code does implement `mgos_app_init()`
 * stub function as a weak symbol, so if user app does not define its own
 * `mgos_app_init()`, a default stub will be used. That's what most of the
 * JavaScript based apps do - they do not contain C code at all.
